This is a community event and in order to stay as inclusive as
possible, we try to keep the admission as low as possible. But, to
make this happen, we need sponsors to cover our costs.

# How to become a sponsor #

If you would like to be a sponsor and support the Hamburg security community, inquire at **elbsides -at- gmail.com**. Information on sponsoring is also available in the [English](/assets/documents/English Sponsor Package Elbsides 2021.pdf) and [German](/assets/documents/German Sponsorpaket Elbsides 2021.pdf) documents. *We are looking forward to working with you!* Contact us if none of these packages is a good fit and we may be able to work out another option for you.
